## [Code](../../src/main/scala/de/htwg/se/chess/aview/TUI.scala)

The **TUI** accepts _text_ input from the **standard input/main console** in the form of:

```<command> <arguments>```

**[Input](#valid-input)** is split into two phases:
 
- First is the **_read_**, which is done in the **run**-method, which loops
  in a _tailrecursion_ until an ExitEvent is detected
 
- The read string from input is then **_evaluated_** in the **eval()** which returns either
  a _Success\[Unit\]_ or _Failure\[Unit\]_, to which the run() **reacts** accordingly.
  
**Reactions** include:

 - On **Success** -> Print the _board_ and _state information_ as well as the type of **executed Event**
 - On **Failure** -> Print an _error message_

**[Output](#board-representation)** is determined by the **_implementation_** chosen for the **GameField** in the **Controller**

---

## Using the **TUI**

The text interface allows for following commands and inputs:

| Syntax | Description | Alias | Input |
| :---------- | :---------: | -----: | :------: |
| **[help](#see-also-command-help-for-more-information)** | Prints a help message describing all commandd | `h` | `Command` |
| **[insert](#inserting-pieces)** | Inserts a piece into the matrix | `put` / `i` | `Tile Piece` |
| **[move](#moving-pieces)** | Moves an already inserted piece to another location | `m` | `Tile Tile` |
| **[clear](#clearing-the-board)** | Clears all pieces from board | `cl` | |
| **[fen](#loading-a-board-with-a-fen-string)** | Loads a Chess position from a given FEN-String | `loadFen` | `FEN-String` |
| **start** | Starts the game, so that you can play | | |
| **stop** | Stops the game | | |
| **undo** | Reverts the last changes you've done | `z` | |
| **redo** | Redoes the last changes you've undone | `y` | |
| **exit** | Quits the program | `q` | |

- All inputs are _case insensitive_

## Valid input

#### For Information on **Tiles**, see [chess.com/terms/chessboard](https://www.chess.com/terms/chessboard)

#### For Information on **Pieces**, see [chess.com/terms/chess-pieces](https://www.chess.com/terms/chess-pieces)
#### For Information on _valid Input_ for **Pieces** see point [Inputs for Pieces](#inputs-for-pieces)

#### Inserting Pieces

`insert` / `i` / `put` `destination tile` `piece`

 - Places the **piece** at the **destination tile**
 - If creation of the piece from String _fails_, the tile will be **cleared**

#### Moving Pieces

`move` / `m` ` source tile`  `destination tile` 

 - Grabs the piece at the **_source_** and moves it to the **_destination_**
 - If the game has been **started**, the move will be _validated_ and only executed if **_valid_**

#### Clearing the Board

`clear`

 - If you wish to _reset_ the **entire** board to an empty state you can do so by using the `clear` command
 - **Note** that, in order to get a correctly initialized starting position you need to use `fen` with the correct FEN

#### Loading a Board with a FEN String

`fen` `FEN String`

 - The **Forsyth-Edwards-Notation** allows to code every needed information of a chess position into a single-line string
 - The Program follows the official FEN notation as described in the **[Chess Programming Wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation)**
 - Additionally: _trailing empty tiles_ in a rank may be omitted:
 - Valid FEN String for the starting position:  `rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/////PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1`
 - See also: our **[Board Representation](#board-representation)**

## Inputs for [Tiles](www.chess.com/terms/chessboard)

- Tiles consist of:
 1. a _character_ describing their **file**.
 These range from 'A' to 'H'; Input is _case insensitive_
 2. an _integer_ describing their **rank**.
 These range from '1' to '8'

- Tiles are numbered from the view of the **white** player.
- Starting with **'A1'** on the bottem left corner and 
ending with **'H8'** in the top right corner

## Board Representation

Game runs on console by printing an 8x8 matrix of boxes with letters - representing Chess pieces - inside them:

```
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| r | n | b | q | k | b | n | r |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| p | p | p | p | p | p | p | p |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| P | P | P | P | P | P | P | P |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| R | N | B | Q | K | B | N | R |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
idle selected: -
w KQkq - 0 1
```

The pieces match the representation in the **[Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation)**.

**_Game State_** is described by the two lines _below_ the board:

 - **idle / playing** : tells you wether the match is _active_
 - **selected** : tells you which tile is _selected_ ('-' for **no tile**)
 - **latter fen part** : contains:
    - **w / b** : Color to make the _next move_
    - **KQkq** : Which color has which castles available (k: kingside, q: queenside)
    - **- / tile** : _En Passant_ target square ('-' if there is **none**)
    - **0 1** : _halfmove_- and _fullmove_-clock

---

 - **Uppercase** letters represent **white** pieces
 - **Lowercase** letters represent **black** pieces

Mappings:
 - **'K'** = *King*
 - **'Q'** = *Queen*
 - **'R'** = *Rook*
 - **'B'** = *Bishop*
 - **'N'** = *Knight*
 - **'P'** = *Pawn*
