## [Code](../../src/main/scala/de/htwg/se/chess/aview/gui)

**_The GUI_** consists of two **Files**:

 - [swingGUI.scala](../../src/main/scala/de/htwg/se/chess/aview/gui/swingGUI.scala)
 - [TileLabel.scala](../../src/main/scala/de/htwg/se/chess/aview/gui/TileLabel.scala)

We use **_Scala Swing_**; a _wrapper_ for **Java Swing** to use it with _scala-like_ Syntax.

We've done **without Tests** as testing the GUI is **too complicated**

## [Chessboard](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Chessboard)
  
Our Chessboard is made with Swings **GridPanel**:
 - Each **square** is a _[TileLabel](../../src/main/scala/de/htwg/se/chess/aview/gui/TileLabel.scala)_ - a custom **Panel** Class we made
 - All of the **_TileLabels_**, plus some panels on the left and bottom for _file and rank indicators_ make up the entire board

### Updating the board
  
The GUI itself **listens* to _Events_, which the _Controller_ publishes.
When **clicking** on a Tile, the corresponding _TileLabel_ detects a _MouseClicked_ Event and runs a _SelectCommand_ on the Controller.
  
This is then send back to the _GUI_ which **updates** the contents of the _GridPanel_ to change the _color_ of the selected Tile and every
Tile the piece on this Tile **can move to**.
  
Clicking on one of the other **marked Tiles** moves the piece to that Tile

Pieces are _drawn_ onto the board by using **_Labels_** and setting the loaded image as **ImageIcon** as the Icon of the Label.

The labels are then _encapsulated_ in a custom **_TileLabel_** class which resides in a **GridPanel** in the **Main Frame**.
