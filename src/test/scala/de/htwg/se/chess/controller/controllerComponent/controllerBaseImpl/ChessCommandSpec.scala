   * ChessCommands are an addition to the Command Pattern, mainly used
   * to implement an undo-redo mechanism.
   * Each commands is instantiated with a GameField on which their operation is
   * executed on.
   * The Field is immutable and only a copy of the changed field is returned.
   * 
   * The standard methods used to put into the higher-order function are:
   *
   *  - MoveCommand(Tuple2[Tile, Tile])      Moves contents of the first into the other
   *  - PutCommand(Tuple2[Tile, String])     Places a Piece created from the string into the tile
   *  - ClearCommand(Unit)                   Clears the entire board
   *  - FenCommand(String)                   Loads a position from a FEN String
   *  - SelectCommand(Option[Tile])          Stores a tile as selected
   *  - ErrorCommand(String)                 Doesn't change the field but contains an ErrorEvent
   * 
   * Each Command is paired with a ChessEvent which is publishable by a Controller on
   * excecution of the command. Observers of the controller should react to given events.
