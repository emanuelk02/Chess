/**
 * A Publisher/Observable used to control the flow of the chess game.
 * ControllerInterface provides functions to execute commands,
 * undo and redo them, as well as provide rudimentary information about
 * the current data held by its GameField.
 * 
 * A typical use of the interface would look like this:
     val ctrl = <Any Implementation of the Interface>

     // moves piece in Tile A2 to Tile D5
     ctrl.executeAndNotify(ctrl.move, (Tile("A2"), Tile("D5")))
 *
 * To subscribe to the publisher, use the scala.swing.Reactor trait
 * and call  "listenTo(controller)"
 * 
 * Along with the Interface come a few predefined events to convey specific
 * signals, the controller notifies its subscribers on.
 * Each CommandInterface holds such an Event, so that it is not necessecary to
 * use case matching to determine which Event to publish.
 * Predefined Events include:
     - CommandExecuted: Simply signals that anything has changed
     - MoveEvent:       Signals on a move being executed and also contains the affected Tiles
     - Select:          Signals that a tile was selected or unselected and also which it was (or None)
     - ErrorEvent:      Conveys that an error has occurred and also an error message
     - ExitEvent:       Signals that the application should be terminated
 * 
 * You may still use <ControllerInterface>.publish(event) to signal events which are not predefined.
 *
