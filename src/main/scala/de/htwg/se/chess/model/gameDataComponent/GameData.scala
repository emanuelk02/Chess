/**
 * A data structure storing all information necessary to
 * run a game of chess.
 * Gamefield provides functional procedures which return a
 * modified version of itself, which also provide functionality for the needs of the
 * ControllerInterface.
 * 
 * GameField encapsulates some sort of Matrix representing a checker board
 * which contains all pieces of the game, along with any
 * functionality to store the state of the game:

     - wether the game is active 
     - wether and if which tile is selected by a controller using the field
     - which color's turn it is 
     - to which sides white and black can castle
     - counters for half-moves and full-moves
 *
 * It utilizes the Tile class to grant unified access for any higher hierarchy classes.
 * A typical use of the interface would look like this:
     val field = [Any Implementation of the Interface]

     // puts a black king into tile A1
     field.replace(Tile("A1"), "B_KING"))
     // move the piece in A1 to B2
     field.move(Tile("A1"), Tile("B2"))

 * of a GameField: GameField()
 *
